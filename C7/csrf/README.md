# CSRF Directory

## Overview

The `csrf` directory contains the implementation and handling mechanisms for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
protection in the application. CSRF is a type of attack where a malicious actor tricks a user into performing unintended
actions on a trusted application where they are authenticated.

## Purpose

This directory is responsible for ensuring the application is protected against CSRF attacks by using appropriate
techniques, such as validating tokens passed with requests from authenticated users. It helps safeguard sensitive
operations (e.g., form submissions, account updates) to ensure they originate from trusted sources.

## How It Works

Typical components within the `csrf` directory might include:

- **CSRF Token Generation**: Code to generate secure random tokens tied to user sessions or requests.
- **Token Validation**: Middleware or utility functions to verify the tokens submitted with each POST, PUT, or DELETE
  request.
- **Error Handling**: Logic to handle invalid or missing CSRF tokens and to respond appropriately (e.g., with an error
  message or redirect).

By leveraging the utilities in this directory, the application enforces CSRF protection through token-based
verification, adding a layer of security to prevent unauthorized actions.
