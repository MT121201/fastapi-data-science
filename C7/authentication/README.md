# Authentication Directory

The `authentication` directory is designed to handle all the logic and processes related to user authentication and
security. The code within leverages **FastAPI** as the main API framework to ensure high performance, simplicity, and
scalability for managing authentication workflows.

### Features and Functionality

The main areas covered by the `authentication` directory include:

- **User Authentication**:
    - Verifies user credentials during the login process (e.g., using username/password).
    - Implements token-based authentication for session management (e.g., JWT).

- **Authorization and Role Management**:
    - Ensures access to resources is restricted based on user roles, permissions, or groups.

- **Password Management**:
    - Handles secure password storage using hashing techniques (e.g., `bcrypt` for hashing user passwords).
    - Allows password reset functionality.

- **Token Security**:
    - Implements secure mechanisms such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user session management.
    - Ensures token expiration and proper refresh workflows for maintaining security.

- **Data Encryption**:
    - Protects sensitive user information through secure encryption mechanisms during storage and transmission.
    - Utilizes HTTPS for secure communication.

- **Middleware for Security**:
    - Integrates FastAPI dependency injection and middleware to enforce authentication on routes.

### Knowledge and Techniques Used

To effectively understand and utilize the `authentication` directory, it is helpful to have knowledge in these areas:

- **FastAPI Framework**: Understanding how to create endpoints, manage dependency injection, and utilize middleware for
  security purposes.
- **OAuth2 and JWT**: Familiarity with OAuth2 workflows, issuing and validating JWT for authentication and
  authorization.
- **Password Hashing**: Experience using libraries like `bcrypt` for securely handling user passwords.
- **Python Libraries**:
    - `fastapi` for building APIs.
    - `pydantic` for validation and settings management.
    - `bcrypt` for secure password hashing.
    - `pyjwt` or similar libraries for managing JSON Web Tokens.
- **Basic Cryptography Concepts**: For secure storage and transmission of sensitive data.
- **Secure API Design**: Knowledge of implementing secure login flows, session management, and permissions.
- **Database Integration**: Experience with databases (e.g., MongoDB or SQLAlchemy) to handle user credentials and other
  related data.

The `authentication` directory is structured with best practices for security, making it a critical component for
safeguarding your application and its users.
